# Loan Default Prediction

## Overview
This project applies supervised machine learning models to predict the likelihood of loan default for a financial institution. The objective was to identify risky applicants early and optimize loan approval decisions.

## Role
- Acted as Scrum Master for a 5-member data science team.
- Responsible for project planning, data preprocessing, and model development.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python, R
- pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn
- SMOTE, NearMiss (for class balancing)
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset was sourced from a banking institution and contains features such as applicant income, credit history, employment status, and loan amount.

## Key Tasks
- Cleaned and preprocessed data
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Applied feature engineering and encoding
- Built and compared multiple classification models
- Evaluated models using accuracy, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

## Results
- Achieved 90% accuracy and strong recall on test data
- Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression on imbalanced data
- Presented insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook: `loan_default_prediction.ipynb`
